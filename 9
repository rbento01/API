This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual. Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it seems that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor! Enduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a prestigious high school famous for its excellent hero training program, and this year's freshmen look especially promising. With his bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero.","autor":"K≈çhei Horikoshi","estudio":"Bones","data":"3rd of April, 2016 until ?","links":"https://beta.crunchyroll.com/pt-pt/series/G6NQ5DWZ6/My-Hero-Academia","fotografia":"Boku_No_Hero.jpg","linkFoto":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78745l.jpg","listaDeReviews":[],"listaDeFavoritos":[],"listaDeCategorias":[]}
