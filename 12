The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the 'Phone Microwave, ' which performs the strange function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's search for a scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a string of mysterious happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected successâ€”the Phone Microwave can send emails to the past, altering the flow of history.
